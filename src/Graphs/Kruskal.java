// Used for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST)
// MST is a tree covering all the vertices in minimum possible cost

// In Kruskal's Algorithm all the edges are sorted acc to their weights
// Edges of less weight are picked such that no cycle is formed
// and all the vertices are covered
// it is a greedy algorithm
// graph must be undirected and weighted
